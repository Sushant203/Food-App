****food recipe app practice using next.js pure css****
This is just a practise app i am doing to get into next.js using help form video platforms. 
This app also have it's own database from where it's data are fetched..


1.) To setup your next app, you can open your terminal and type :
>> npx create-next-app @latest
and your next app building process will be started. Thenafter, it will ask for your projects name [mine's: mealApp]

2.) Currently, I am using SQLite3 with next.js as my database..
To setup SQLite3 into your next app, you can use the following code:
>> npm i better sqlite3
