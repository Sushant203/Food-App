revalidate(): 
revalidates the cache that belongs to a certain route path.
if i wanna visit the meals page and it depends on the data that changes, this revalidate will revalidates the '/meals' path.

'/meals' will only revalidate the meals path not it's nested path.

or we can pass another argument to revalidate the nested paths..
 
        There are two ways to do so:
        see this docs for more :
        "https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidatePath"

revalidate means that Nextjs throws away all the cache that is associated with the route.
